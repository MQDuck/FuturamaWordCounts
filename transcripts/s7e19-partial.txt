Sergeant : Mr. President. I found the TV remote.

Nixon : Good work, Sergeant. I'm awarding you the purple heart.

Sergeant : But I wasn't injured.
[Nixon shoots a gun at him, then opens a trap door] Ow! [Screams]

Nixon : Well, enough governing. It's Saturday morning, damn it. Let's watch some cartoons.


[Grunts] Announcer: It's time to fall into The Futurama and Friends Saturday Morning Fun Pit! Here comes Bendee-Boo and the Mystery Crew!

Lead Singer : ♪ Bendee, Bendee-Boo, what's wrong with you? ♪ You're such a lousy mascot. ♪ No one understands a single word you say. ♪ Not even the jerk in the ascot.


Bendee Boo : Rite my riny retal rass! [Owl hoots] [Repeated hooting]

[Cut to the Mystery Express vehicle]

Leela : It sure was nice of your nephew to invite us to his cloning lab here in the repeating forest.

Fry : Hey, like, here's a puzzler. How old are we on a scale of 14 to 32?

[Laugh track plays]

Fry : Did anyone else hear that weird laugh? It's spooky.

Leela : It doesn't seem to correspond to anything funny happening.

Fry : I'll say.

[Laugh track plays]

[Spooky music plays]

Dragon Ghost : Turn around. Go away. Do it now.

Bendee Boo : Rikes!

Fry : Splinkies! What was that?

Leela : I don't know.

Hermes : It's a mystery.

Fry : Like, I've got a bigger mystery. How am I going to fill my hungry stomach?

[Laugh track plays]

Fry : Yeah. Leela : Where can we find food here in the woods? How about that Kabuki Theater?

Fry : Like, where there's a Kabuki Theater, there's a concession stand.

[Laugh track plays]

[Cut to inside Kabuki Theatre]

Hermes : Say, Fry, why do you always have the munchies? And also your eyes are bloodshot, you're paranoid, and the van has a skunky odor.

Fry : Search me. No, don't. I'm carrying. [Chuckles]

[Laugh track plays]

[Spooky scream] [Screaming] [Laughing]

[They try to run but don't get anywhere. This is because this is always what happens on Scooby Doo although George claims it's because his floor has butter on it]

George Takei : I do enjoy a well-buttered floor.

All except Bendee Boo : George Takei?

Bendee Boo : Reorge rakei?

George Takei : Sorry to haunt you so effectively. I thought you kids were that dragon ghost that's been spooking the town.

Fry : Like, what's the story with the Yakitori?

George Takei : Help yourselves. But I warn you, that chicken is over a year old.

[Laugh track plays]

Amy : Why is the food in your concession stand so old, Mr. Takei?

George Takei : You see, Amy, this used to be the most popular Kabuki Theater in the entire outskirts of town. But people stopped coming after they built that darned basketball arena.

[Brief shot of the arena. Spooky music plays]

George Takei : Now everybody likes basketball instead of Kabuki. It's an insult to my Japanese heritage.

Amy : How so? This is America, not Japan.

George Takei : Maybe so. I'm not sure. Now, how many tickets would you like for the show?

Fry : Like, none. But thanks for the yucky-tori. [Chuckles]

George Takei : Another grave insult to my ancestry. [Laugh track plays] [Doorbell rings]

Leela : Nu? Is this the Professor's cloning lab?
