Hey, guys. Welcome to my parents' I'm bored. Let's drink. Wow, what a turnout. It's great to see so many happy smiles, most of them on mouth mutant. (All laugh) All: Hey-o!

Morris: But let me just say, for 40 years, my beautiful wife Munda has been by my side Even that year my side mutated into some kind of venomous radish.

Munda: And, Morris, I fell in love with your honesty and humility.And those things never mutated.

Both: Mmm All: Aw (Guttural): Aw

Leela: Now, if you'll direct your attention to this moldy shower curtain, I've prepared a video tribute to the happy couple. In their 40 years together, my parents have been through so much. Well, not that much, actually, since mutants weren't allowed to leave the sewers until last year.

Like anyone wants to leave the sewer. Am I right? (All laugh) Shush, Morris.

Leela: So, how did it all begin? The unlikely lovebirds met at Brown University. She, a brilliant exolinguistics major, he, a laid-back sewer surfer who didn't even know the meaning of "exolinguistics".

Morris: I still have no idea.

(All laugh)

Munda: I've been telling you for 40 years, it's the study of alien languages. Why can't you listen?

Morris: Oh, sugar lump, I hear you when you actually say something important.

Leela: But sometimes opposites attract, and like the fairy tale of face mutant and butt mutant, the love of Munda and Morris has grown stronger every day.

Munda: "Something important"? Exolinguistics was my passion. Until I gave it up to go into the lucrative pot-roast-making field.

Morris: Pot-roast-burning. I never got why you studied that alien junk anyway. We can't even see the stars down here in the sewer. Why can't you accept that?

Munda: I did accept it for 40 years! But now we're free to go up there. I could be in space seeing things I've only dreamed about, if it weren't for you!

Uh, okay, everybody, thanks for coming.

Morris: I had dreams, too! I was going to surf the world's sewers, but I happily gave it up for you. Happily!

Munda: I just want a little more out of life. But no, you don't want to go into space because you're too afraid.

Morris: You bet I'm afraid. You want to go? Go! Get your head knocked off by a meteorite.

Leela: Okay, take a deep breath. You're having a little lovers' quarrel, but I'm sure you'll work everything -

Raoul Inglis: Divorce is final.

Munda: Don't worry. I'm only going to stay with you until a vacancy opens up on this floor.
